The Movie Recommender System is an intelligent application designed to help users discover new movies tailored to their individual preferences. 
Using advanced machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes user behavior and historical movie ratings to generate personalized recommendations.



This project is built using the MovieLens 25M dataset. The MovieLens dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for recommendation systems research,
containing ratings and metadata for movies. The 25M version of the dataset consists of 25 million ratings from 162,000 users on 62,000 movies. 
For more information and to download the dataset, visit the [MovieLens website](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/).
